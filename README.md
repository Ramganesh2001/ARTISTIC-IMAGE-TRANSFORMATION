# ARTISTIC-IMAGE-TRANSFORMATION
In this modern world, creating a web application to cartoonize images in various ways is more fascinating. Users can turn their images into fascinating cartoons using the application's six different cartoonization techniques, which include adaptive thresholding, clustering, stylization, color enhancement, and pencil-sketch-like effects. Users can upload photos, select a favorite style, and view the updated photos instantly. Because of the project's modular design, cartoonization styles can be easily expanded or altered. The application keeps the cartoonized images in the 'cartoon_images' folder and the uploaded images in the 'uploads' directory. It serves as a concrete example of how computer vision and web development can be combined to create a friendly platform for imaginative image manipulation.
